##### Introduction 
There are many song sheet applications out there, but none of them do justice to a mixed band. 
Many different users access many different songs, change parts of them and often destroy the song sheet files because they are not in a database where user rights can be assigned for different functions. At the same time, they only mean well when a transposition or capo setting is made. The Songsheets Manager app is here to help. An app that is tailor-made for mixed bands. Databases containing RAW files and user-defined changes give the user a new way to manage and edit songsheet files.
