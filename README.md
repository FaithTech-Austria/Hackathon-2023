#### Introduction 
There are many song sheet applications out there, but none of them do justice to a mixed band. 
Many different users access many different songs, change parts of them and often destroy the song sheet files because they are not in a database where user rights can be assigned for different functions. At the same time, they only mean well when a transposition or capo setting is made. Help with the development of Songsheets Manager, a tailor-made app for mixed bands which helps worship teams work together more easily.

#### Tasks
1. Screen Design (Mock-Ups) and implementation in Flutter
